# Python - Async Comprehension

Async comprehensions in Python allow for asynchronous iteration over asynchronous iterables. This feature, introduced in Python 3.6, combines the power of asynchronous programming with the concise syntax of comprehensions. It is particularly useful for handling large datasets or I/O-bound tasks efficiently by leveraging the `async for` and `await` keywords within list, set, dictionary, and generator comprehensions.

Key points:
- Async comprehensions improve readability and maintainability of asynchronous code.
- They help in writing cleaner and more efficient asynchronous loops.
- Useful in scenarios involving asynchronous data streams or network operations.

Example:
```python
result = [await process(item) async for item in async_iterable]
```
