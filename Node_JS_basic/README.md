NodeJS Basics
Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling the development of scalable network applications.

Key features of Node.js include:

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous, meaning that the server does not wait for an API to return data. This makes Node.js highly efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
- **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping, which helps handle multiple connections simultaneously. This makes it more scalable compared to traditional servers that create limited threads to handle requests.
- **Fast Execution**: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, making it extremely fast in execution.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js comes with a built-in package manager called NPM, which hosts a vast collection of open-source libraries and modules that can be easily integrated into projects.

Node.js is widely used for building web servers, real-time applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices. Its non-blocking architecture and efficient performance make it a popular choice among developers for creating high-performance applications.
