# Pagination

Pagination is a technique used in Python to divide a large dataset into smaller, more manageable chunks, or "pages". This is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data that cannot be efficiently processed or displayed all at once. By breaking the data into pages, you can load and display data incrementally, improving performance and user experience.

Commonly, pagination is implemented in web applications to handle large lists of items, such as search results or database records. Python libraries like `Flask` and `Django` provide built-in support for pagination, making it easier to integrate this functionality into your applications.

Key concepts in pagination include:
- **Page Size**: The number of items displayed on each page.
- **Current Page**: The page number currently being viewed.
- **Total Items**: The total number of items in the dataset.
- **Total Pages**: The total number of pages required to display all items.

By using pagination, you can ensure that your applications remain responsive and user-friendly, even when dealing with large datasets.
